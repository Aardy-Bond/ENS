Ethereum Name Service (ENS) DApp

Background

When the web first began, users accessed websites by entering IP addresses. This changed with the introduction of Domain Name System (DNS), which allowed domain names to be linked to IP addresses, making it easier to navigate the web.

The Ethereum blockchain also uses addresses, but these are long and complex, making them hard to remember. This is where Ethereum Name Service (ENS) comes in, functioning similarly to DNS but for blockchain addresses. ENS maps long Ethereum addresses and other identifiers (like content hashes) to easy-to-read names such as example.eth.

Unlike DNS, which is centralized, ENS operates through smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, providing censorship-resistant domain resolution.

What is ENS?

ENS is a decentralized naming system for Ethereum addresses and other assets. Instead of using complex wallet addresses, ENS allows users to register readable domain names (e.g., tom.eth), making it easier to send and receive funds.

It also extends functionality by allowing users to attach additional data to their ENS name, such as a profile picture, social media links, and more, making it a versatile identification tool.

Project Overview

In this project, we'll build a DApp that allows users to search for an Ethereum address and display its associated ENS name (if available).

Features

ENS domain lookup: Query and display ENS names for Ethereum addresses.
Wallet integration: Users can connect their Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
Censorship-resistant: The entire ENS system is powered by Ethereum smart contracts.
User profiles: Users can view additional metadata like profile pictures or social media links linked to ENS names.
