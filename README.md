# ENS
This project is about creating a decentralized application (dApp) that displays Ethereum Name Service (ENS) names for wallet addresses. Using React, Next.js, and RainbowKit for wallet integration, users can connect their wallets and view the corresponding ENS name. The app is deployed on Vercel for easy sharing and access.
